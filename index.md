## About
I am an assistant professor in the  [Cognitive Science and Artificial Intelligence department](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/about/schools/tshd/departments/dca) at Tilburg University. After my studies in the discrete algebra and geometry group of the department of Mathematics and Computer science in Eindhoven,  I defended my Ph.D. thesis in January 2012. That was about generalisations of a combinatorial theorem from Erdos, Ko and Rado over families of 
intersecting sets. The thesis involved algebraic graph theory and combinatorics. For the following four years, I worked in the industry in banking and consultancy environments as a quant and a 
data analyst, working with financial and trade data mainly. Then I returned to academia as a postdoc in the system architecture and network group at TUE in 2016. During my postdoc, I focused 
on computational trust, machine learning and sensor data.

My research interests include network analysis and learning on graph-structured data. I focus on understanding the relationship between graph structure—both topological and spectral properties—and the learning process. My work applies graph-theoretical approaches to network analysis, particularly in studying network evolution, detecting key substructures for community detection or explainability, and making predictions on graph-structured data. Examples include brain networks and electrical grids. I am particularly interested in how relationships, communication, similarity, and information exchange—captured in edges—shape network structure, influence motif formation, and impact learning.


Data science projects with a social aspect motivates me a lot. This interest is visible in multiple research projects I am involved in, utilising AI to create a more inclusive and accessible world. Some examples are the 'Child Growth Monitor' by Zero hunger lab; focusing on malnutrition detection in children, Ilustre, a project to support the energy transition efforts in the Caribbean, and the Icon project of Zero poverty lab, linking brain networks and poverty. 

I serve as the lab manager of the ICAI lab [Ilustre](https://www.icai.ai/labs/ilustre-lab). I am in the scientific advisory board for informatics of the [Lorentz Center](https://www.icai.ai/labs/ilustre-lab).
