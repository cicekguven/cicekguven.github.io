<h1>Çiçek Güven</h1>
<p>I am an assistant professor in the Cognitive Science and Artificial Intelligence department at Tilburg University.</p>

<p>In  August 2018, I joined the CSAI department in the school of Humanities and Digital Sciences in Tilburg University.  Since then, I studied behavioral link analytics and knowledge based link prediction.  My research interests in general are network analysis, graph structured data, and data mining.  For the near future, I want to focus on problems that brings combinatorics and machine learning together,  for example for deep learning network design and optimisation purposes. Data science projects with a social aspect motivates me a lot.</p>

<p>After my studies in the discrete algebra and geometry group of the department of Mathematics and Computer science in Eindhoven, I defended my Ph.D. thesis in January 2012. That was about generalisations of a combinatorial theorem from Erdos, Ko and Rado over families of intersecting sets. The thesis involved algebraic graph theory and combinatorics. For the following four years, I worked in the industry in banking and consultancy environments as a quant and a data analyst, working with financial and trade data mainly. Then I returned to academia as a postdoc in the system architecture and network group at TUE. During my postdoc, I focused on computational trust, machine learning and sensor data. </p>
