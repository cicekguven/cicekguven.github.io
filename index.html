<h1>Çiçek Güven</h1>
<p>I am an assistant professor in the <a href="https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/about/schools/humanities/departments/dca">Cognitive 
  Science and Artificial Intelligence</a> department at Tilburg University. After my studies in the discrete algebra and geometry
  group of the department of Mathematics and Computer science in Eindhoven, 
  I defended my Ph.D. thesis in January 2012. That was about generalisations of a combinatorial theorem from Erdos, Ko and Rado over 
  families of intersecting sets. The thesis involved algebraic graph theory and combinatorics. For the following four years, 
  I worked in the industry in banking and consultancy environments as a quant and a data analyst, working with financial and trade data mainly. 
My research interests in general are network analysis,  and learning on graph structured data. 
  Then I returned to academia as a postdoc in the system architecture and network group at TUE in 2016. 
  During my postdoc, I focused on computational trust, machine learning and sensor data. 


  
  Data science projects with a 
  social aspect motivates me a lot. 
  This interest is effectuated in multiple research projects I am involved in utilising AI to create a more inclusive and accessible world.
  Some examples are  the 'Child Growth Monitor' by Zero hunger lab;  focusing on malnutrition detection in children,  Ilustre, a project  to support the energy transition efforts in the Caribbean, and the Icon project of Zero poverty lab, linking brain networks and poverty.</p>
I am interested in  graph theoretical approaches to network analysis with a focus on  structure and dynamics of network evolution,  detecting important substructures possibly for community detection, or explainability purposes and making predictions on graph structural data.   Brain networks or electrical grids can be examples of these networks. I am interested in understanding the link between  the phenomena that are captured in edges- relationships, communication, similarity, exchange of information- and their impact on the structure of the network and formation of motifs and their possible impact on learning.    Network analysis and learning on graph structural data are complementary to each other and a research direction that links these together is  explainability of learning,  
  in answering questions like what structural properties of the graph leads to certain prediction outcomes?</p>
