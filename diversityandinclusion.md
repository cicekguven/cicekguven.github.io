## Diversity and Inclusion

Diversity, equity and inclusion are themes that I feel very strongly about in life, education and in the working environment. This commitment drives my involvement in various initiatives aimed at promoting these principles.


I represent our department in the [IPN EDI working group](https://ict-research.nl/edi-working-group/), where we work to advance equity and inclusion within the academic community. Additionally, I serve on the Diversity and Inclusion Committee at the Tilburg School of Humanities and Digital Sciences [TSHD](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/nl/over/schools/tshd), focusing on fostering a more inclusive environment within our school.

I was in the scientific committee of Hack4her event [2024 edition](https://hack4her.github.io/2024_event.html), where I gave a talk titled "Using AI to support Accessibility for All".In this presentation, I highlighted how our research prioritizes inclusivity and accessibility, addressing societal challenges through our chosen research problems, methodologies, and developed frameworks.

Moreover, I am actively engaged in what I term "informed educational innovation." This involves continuously updating educational programs to meet contemporary standards while addressing the diverse needs of students, such as ensuring inclusivity in assessments and classroom settings.
