## Diversity and Inclusion

Diversity, equity and inclusion are themes that I feel very strongly about in life, education and in the working environment. This commitment drives my involvement in various initiatives aimed at promoting these principles.

I represent our department in the [IPN EDI working group](https://ict-research.nl/edi-working-group/), where we work to advance equity and inclusion within the academic community. Additionally, I serve on the Diversity and Inclusion Committee at the Tilburg School of Humanities and Digital Sciences [TSHD](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/nl/over/schools/tshd), focusing on fostering a more inclusive environment within our school.

I participated in the scientific committee of the [Hack4her 2024 event(https://hack4her.github.io/2024_event.html), where I presented a talk titled 'Using AI to Support Accessibility for All.' In this presentation, I discussed how our research emphasizes inclusivity and accessibility, focusing on addressing societal challenges through our research topics, methodologies, and developed frameworks.

In June 2023, I organized  a workshop named "[Science and AI in Support of Diversity and Inclusion](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/about/schools/tshd/departments/dca/science-and-ai-support-diversity-and-inclusion)" on behalf of our department. The overarching goal of this workshop was to shed light on the positive contributions that artificial intelligence can make towards building a more inclusive society.  We had people from several departments  (philosophy, cultural studies, law, communication and cognition) in our school and beyond, as well as other universities.

With several members of our department, we published the paper "[AI in Support of Diversity and Inclusion](https://arxiv.org/html/2501.09534v1)".  It focuses on several research projects/lines where ai is being useful to provide solutions,  like gender bias in language, media representation of people in media (images), bias mitigation and quantification methods, Dynamics of LGBTQ+ disinformation across europe, diversifying datasets, automatic translation of sign language for hard hearing people etc. 

I like to tackle the diversity issue in different ways, really as an experience in the workplace for us, in the classroom for students, but also with how our work contributes to it. That is why I wanted to have this paper put together.
