## Diversity and Inclusion

Diversity, equity and inclusion are themes that I feel very strongly about in life, education and in the working environment. That is why I am involved in several initiatives about that.
I am representing my department in the [IPN EDI working group](https://ict-research.nl/edi-working-group/).
I am in the diversity and Inclusion committee of our school, [TSHD](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/nl/over/schools/tshd).

I was in the scientific committee of Hack4her event [2024 edition](https://hack4her.github.io/2024_event.html), where I gave a talk titled "Using AI to support Accessibility for All". With this talk, I gave examples of how we center our research around inclusivity, accessibility, and societal problems, both in the problems we focus on and in the methods we use and frameworks we develop.

Something I am thinking active about ism what I call informed educational innovation; how to keep educational programs up to date,  but also the needs of the students, 
in terms of inclusivity for example in assesment or in the classroom.
