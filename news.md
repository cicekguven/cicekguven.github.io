## Upcoming events

Our paper "Grid-Aware Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks for Multi-Horizon Load Forecasting" is accepted to be presented at the 
[The 14th DACH+ Conference on Energy Informatics](https://energy-informatics2025.org/).

Our paper titled "Determining graphlet explanations for machine learning on graphs" is accepted to be published in Plos Complex systems journal. This is first authored by Bettina Soos, who is a PhD candidate.

## Recent Past
I am appointed as an Associate Professor in Tilburg University DEpartment of Cognitive Science and Artificial Intelligence as of August 1 2025.

I was be presenting at the [France's International Conference on Complex Systems FRCCS 2025](https://iutdijon.u-bourgogne.fr/ccs-france/).

[Aran: Age-restricted anonymized dataset of images and measurements of children](https://dataverse.nl/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.34894/FWYPYC) dataset is released. We believe this will contribute to the research around learning body measurements of children from 2D images, having a lot of potential in healthcare applications. 

I  chaired the  Learning on Graphs session on June 12 in the [4'th AIM Cluster event](https://aimath.nl/index.php/2025/03/13/4th-aim-cluster-event-tilburg/). Join us in Tilburg.

We attended [NetSCi conference](https://netsci2025.github.io/) in the week of June 2-6 and  Valentina Sanchez Melchor will be presenting our work.
