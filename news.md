[Aran: Age-restricted anonymized dataset of images and measurements of children](https://dataverse.nl/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.34894/FWYPYC) dataset is released. we believe this will contribute to the research around learning body measurements of children from 2D images, having a lot of potential in healthcare applications.
